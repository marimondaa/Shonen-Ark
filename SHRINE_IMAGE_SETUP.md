# Adding the Shrine Image to Shonen Ark

## Issue
The shrine background image isn't displaying because it needs to be properly saved as a binary image file.

## Solution
To add your shrine illustration:

1. **Save the shrine image:**
   - Right-click on the shrine illustration you provided
   - Save it as `shrine-ink-hero.png` 
   - Place it in: `public/assets/illustrations/shrine-ink-hero.png`

2. **Update the homepage:**
   - Once the image is saved, uncomment lines in `pages/index.js`:
   ```javascript
   // Remove the CSS background pattern and uncomment:
   <img 
     src="/assets/illustrations/shrine-ink-hero.png" 
     alt="" 
     className="w-full h-full object-cover opacity-20 blur-sm scale-110"
   />
   ```
