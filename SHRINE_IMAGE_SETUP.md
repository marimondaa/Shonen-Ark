# Adding the Shrine Image to Shonen Ark

## Issue
The shrine background image isn't displaying because it needs to be properly saved as a binary image file.

## Solution
To add your shrine illustration:

1. **Save the shrine image:**
   - Right-click on the shrine illustration you provided
   - Save it as `shrine-ink-hero.png` 
   - Place it in: `public/assets/illustrations/shrine-ink-hero.png`

2. **Update the homepage:**
   - Once the image is saved, uncomment lines in `pages/index.js`:
   ```javascript
   // Remove the CSS background pattern and uncomment:
   <img 
     src="/assets/illustrations/shrine-ink-hero.png" 
     alt="" 
     className="w-full h-full object-cover opacity-20 blur-sm scale-110"
   />
   ```

## Current Status
- âœ… Shrine background image successfully added and displayed
- âœ… Bokoko33-inspired design implementation complete
- âœ… Enhanced animations and navigation with pink/beige color palette
- âœ… Generous spacing and smooth hover interactions implemented
- âœ… All animations and navigation working properly
- âœ… Homepage fully functional with mystical atmosphere
- ðŸ“¤ Ready to push to GitHub: Run `git add . && git commit -m "Mystical homepage complete" && git push origin main`

## Alternative
If you prefer, you can:
1. Use any shrine/temple image you like
2. Name it `shrine-ink-hero.png`
3. Place it in the `public/assets/illustrations/` folder
